Cookie Max Size
===
- The max size of Cookie in common Browsers are `4093 bytes ~ 4 kb` per domain.
- If the size of Cookie is over 4 Kb, you will be unable store or `put` anything else in Cookie for that domain anymore.
- If you get a bug related to login (unable login), so you begin debugging and you found out that it caused by the Cookie, because of a particular value unable set or put into Cookie... So you have to check you value that use to put into Cookie, is that too large? or your Cookie in the browser is over 4 Kb.
- Should only save values really need to save in Cookie.
